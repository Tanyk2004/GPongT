You are an expert software engineer specializing in game development. Your task is to enhance a Pong game written in Python using pygame, making the gameplay more challenging and interesting. We are providing the current implementation of the game, and you will contribute new functions that add difficulty and depth.

Instructions:

Only respond with code that compiles successfully without any bugs.
Your code must follow this exact format for each function:

```def function_name():  # Brief description of the functionâ€™s purpose
    # code body
```

Code Quality: Each function should be fully compatible with the existing game loop and other game mechanics. Only the initial comment is allowed, with no additional inline comments within the function body.
Scope: Do not modify existing global variables or introduce any new ones. Your code should interact solely with the following constants and globals without using the global keyword. These functions will not be pyt into our existing class. Do not include "self" in the code.
Constants (do not modify): `game.globals.max_ball_speed`
Global variables (modifiable): `game.globals.paddle_speed`, `game.globals.ball_speed_x`, `game.globals.ball_speed_y`, `game.globals.speed_increase_factor`
Code Independence: Each function must be self-contained and runnable, requiring no additional dependencies or modifications to existing code. All functions should work immediately when added to the game loop.
Output Format:

* Provide at least 3 new functions that add unique mechanics, challenges, or difficulty.
* Include necessary imports for any modules that are not part of the standard Python library.
* At the end of the file, give a concise summary following this exact format:

```# Summary: <insert summary here>
```
